Next steps (not necessarily in order):

- Develop the Front end.
  Maybe react? 
  Maybe Angular for a SPA ?

- Provide endpoints for a mobile app
  Just to show the data, not to edit that.

- Develop the login page and the maintenance.
  It will be a long way... But it's just mandatory for production, not for the 
  first version which was created to show mine portfy.

- Serve images as static data from a folder
  Stop storing them on the jar packaging xD
  We can store URL as path... So when it grows, the images can be stored on S3
  ...or something like that. 

- Prepare for production use
  Spring Profiles
     Create a  Production one.
  Search for a fast and better database server.

- Populate that with real data
  My data
  Math data.

- Prepare for the V1.0 release
  Show it to everyone :D
